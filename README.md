# odin-project-todo

Next step: Make the form editable.
Attach delete button to each todo item
--> Finish button setup in index.js

This should still work: 
npx webpack --watch


What should the to-do do? 
Create // Manage
Delete // Manage
Change due date
Set and change priority
Set/unset state (done)
