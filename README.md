N
!!! The restructure of elements means the event listeners for buttons
no longer work - the elements are placed differently. Fix this.

ext step: CSS and page layout

- Make all forms pop up at center, using class name instead of current editing id
- Grid layout for main elements
- Grid layout structure for todos




When page layout works and projects are displayed, THEN: 
render project todolist -- looks for project -- filters/loops todos and only return with matching project



This should still work: 
npx webpack --watch
