# odin-project-todo

Next step: Make the form editable.
Attach correct ID to form somehow to make connection between form values and todo object. 


This should still work: 
npx webpack --watch


What should the to-do do? 
Create // Manage
Delete // Manage
Change due date
Set and change priority
Set/unset state (done)
