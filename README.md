# odin-project-todo

Next step: Make the form editable.
Form ID passed to render.js function.
Match the passed ID value with the form in our todo list, then set the values in the edit form to 
equal those in the object.



This should still work: 
npx webpack --watch


What should the to-do do? 
Create // Manage
Delete // Manage
Change due date
Set and change priority
Set/unset state (done)
