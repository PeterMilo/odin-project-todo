# odin-project-todo

Next step: Add project structure to todos


Project structure: Next --> Add submit functionality between index.js and manage-todo.js

todolist > todo > project: value

render project todolist -- looks for project -- filters/loops todos and only return with matching project



This should still work: 
npx webpack --watch
