# odin-project-todo

Next step: Figure out how to remove a todo. Right now I cant declare a global scope function in the index.js
either and dont know why. So start there. Would just be nice to test first. 

This should still work: 
npx webpack --watch


Properties needed for to-do item: 
title, description, dueDate, priority

What should the to-do do? 
Create // Manage
Delete // Manage
Change due date
Set and change priority
Set/unset state (done)
